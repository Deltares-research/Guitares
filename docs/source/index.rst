Welcome to the Guitares documentation!
======================================

Guitares is a Python package for building configurable Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) using the PyQt5 framework. GUI configurations can be defined programmatically, but are typically provided by the developer in YAML configuration files.

A Guitares GUI consists of a main window (with optional drop-down menu) that contains one or more UI elements. Guitares currently support the following UI elements (or widgets):

* Tab panel
* Panel
* Edit box
* Pop-up menu
* List box
* Slider
* Push button
* Web view
* MapBox map

Please see the Element section for more information about each UI element.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for instructions on how to get started!
