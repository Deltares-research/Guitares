A Simple Example
================


First section

The Python code for a simple GUI consists of four components:

* An ***run module***, which is the script to start running the application
* An ***app module***, which contains a class that holds all of the GUI configuration data, and builds up the GUI
* A ***callback module***, which contains the different functions (or methods) that are called when the user interacts with the GUI
* A YAML ***configuration file***, which contains information about the main window, as well as the various UI elements in the GUI

Let's have a look at a very simple GUI in which the user is asked to enter her or his name, and is then greeted by the program.
